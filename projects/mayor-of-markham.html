        Whenever my friends and I had a break while we were on campus, we would sometimes play a board game called Sheriff of Nottingham. It was fun and we really enjoyed playing it. However, the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic happened and we couldn't meet up to play anymore. I created this spin-off on the game which is played with the assistance of a Discord bot so that we can experience that same enjoyment again while practicing social distancing. The logo and name of the bot was inspired by one of my friends who owned the board game and would bring it in for us to play.
