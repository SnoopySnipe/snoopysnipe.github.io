        This was a final project that I worked on with 2 other students for the course CSCC09: Programming on the Web. The inspiration for this web application came from the fact that we have a large friend group and whenever a new semester was starting, it would be difficult to manage our schedules. This was because we all wanted to know what courses the others were taking and adjust our timeslots in such a way that we could meet up with each other on campus as frequently as possible, whether it be during classes or breaks. Thus we decided to develop a social networking web application centered around users' schedules, allowing you to:
        <ul>
            <li>Connect with other users through groups and friend recommendations</li>
            <li>Customize a personal schedule with events and courses</li>
            <li>Compare schedules side-by-side with other users</li>
            <li>and many more!</li>
        </ul>
        For this project I mainly worked on implementing and documenting the APIs as well as deploying the back-end on Heroku and the front-end on Microsoft Azure. As a result, I learned a lot about deployment, Golang, NoSQL databases, and web development in general. I enjoyed working on this project a lot and would definitely like to revisit these topics in the future since I'm sure there is still much more for me to learn.
