        As regular users of Discord, a few friends and I thought that it was difficult to find a bot that satisfied all of our needs, so we decided to develop one of our own! This allowed for us to have full control over how we want to customize the bot's functionalities and got rid of all the frustrations that came with using several bots in one server. Some features include:
        <ul>
            <li>Streaming audio from YouTube videos into voice channels</li>
            <li>Creating polls for members of the server to vote in</li>
            <li>Creating events for members of the server to declare their attendance</li>
            <li>Playing custom minigames with users</li>
            <li>Birthday reminders</li>
            <li>Serving images from image boards</li>
            <li>Providing wiki data for various games</li>
        </ul>
        The bot also comes with its own game that we call PikaGacha. In this game, players register as trainers and collect Pokemon in a gacha-like system. Currency is only earned through participation in the server so don't worry, no gambling of real-life money is involved. The currency is called "pikapoints" and methods of earning these include being active in voice channels or participating in a game of "Who's That Pokemon?" that occurs periodically. What can trainers do with the Pokemon they collect you ask? At the moment there is only support for trainers to battle or trade between each other, but more is planned for the future!
